# The Disappearing Rabbit

Magicians usually pull rabbits out of empty hats.

In this case, we're doing it the other way round. We put a rabbit into a hat (actually a HashSet) and let it disappear!

Check the asserts of the [RabbitTest.java](src/test/java/de/swa/magic/RabbitTest.java). In the first one, the rabbit is found in the hat. In the second one, it's gone! Why is that so?!?
